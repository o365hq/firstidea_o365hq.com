description = "Small and medium businesses have to deal with the same cyberattacks and the same industry and government data regulations as large companies â€“ but, without the big IT department and budget to plan and implement protective measures. Migration to the cloud helps, but still leaves some very important vulnerabilities like Social Engineering-based attacks. We will help you evaluate how secure your business data is and propose concrete steps to fix the vulnerabilities. "

Users face multiple threats --- from credential theft (like Mimikatz,
password spray, or breach harvesting) to malware (viruses, ransomware,
and the like), to phishing (gaining access to a user's credentials) and
infrastructure attacks.

[Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) is by far a number
one threat for any company these days. Cloud-migrated organizations are
especially vulnerable because they got almost a perfect environment --
everything is configured correct and documents, historic emails dating
back many years, company info is available at **ANY time**,
from **ANY device**, from **ANY place**. Criminals
don't need to waste their time figuring out host names, encryption
types, protocols, and getting through some mistakes in integration and
external publishing of internal services. Everything works all the time,
everywhere. But there's a solution -- companies need to start using
tools and services that already exists and built into the platform but
not enabled by default. Some of them are very powerful and free, like
basic level of MFA. Some will require an additional license.

With the Free Office 365 Security Assessment service, IT Partner will
connect to your Office 365 tenant and use tools like Secure Score, Azure
AD and PowerShell to generate a Security Report which will reflect your
current situation and contain a prioritized list of recommendations on
how to increase your data security, control and protection.

Our **objective** is to assess your current security state and offer
solutions to remediate high priority security concerns.

Project will be considered **successful** when you get information
about:

1.  Your single-digit SecureScore
2.  List of potential vulnerabilities sorted by the order of importance
3.  Recommendation on how to increase your protection and SecureScore
4.  Quote for IT Partner's services in case you'd like us to work on
    your tenant hardening
