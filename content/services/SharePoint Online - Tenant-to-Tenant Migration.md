As more organizations move to Office 365 during mergers and
acquisitions, they need robust solutions to consolidate their SharePoint
Online infrastructure and documents. We will help to migrate site
collections, sites, lists and libraries with permissions and design.

Our **objective** is to migrate documents, sites and structure from one
SharePoint tenant to another.

Project will be considered **successful** when all data has been moved
from one tenant to another correctly in an agreed time-frame.

Our **responsibilities**. First, we check the source SharePoint Online
tenant for compatibility with the new tenant and help fix any errors (if
the destination tenant is not empty). In this type of merging, we use
special tools that provide a set of features and flexible options to
help us maintain data integrity, permission levels, version histories
and metadata. We also use auditing and reporting tools to help plan,
configure and granularly migrate content. We create the Document
Migration project and add the items that will be migrated to the
project. We then set the advanced project options and perform the
migration. Upon completion of the project, we prevent users from
inadvertently using older SharePoint libraries by decommissioning the
Source SharePoint Online, libraries, or user accounts. After the process
is done, we verify files and structure and perform post-migration tasks.
