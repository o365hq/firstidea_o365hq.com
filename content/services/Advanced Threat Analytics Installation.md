**ATA technologies** can detect many types of suspicious
activity at various stages of an attack, including the following:\
-Collecting information about your infrastructure, during which
attackers can get data about the network structure, devices, such as
servers, network storages or PCs;\
- The implementation, during which attackers spread malware within the
network, using software vulnerabilities or unsafe settings of services
and servers;\
- Managing a domain, during this stage, the attacker collects
information that allows him to resume the attack using different
credentials, entry points and vulnerabilities.

ATA identifies three main types of threats: cyberattacks,
abnormal activities and problems, and security risks.

Our **objective** is to plan, design and implement Advanced Threat
Analytics service.
