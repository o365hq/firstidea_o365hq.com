### IT Partner responsibilities

Create and implement one of the following automation services:

1.  Approval process when a new item is added to SharePoint. The
    approver can view his approval requests in the Approvals Center and

    receives a confirmation email
2.  Tracking your work hours and work location. Each button tap logs the
    current time and location to an Excel table

    manually tracking sales leads, let Microsoft Flow notify you of new
    Dynamics 365 or Salesforce opportunities as they're generated

    and Facebook
