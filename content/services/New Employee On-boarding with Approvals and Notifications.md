Using this service we will develop a solution which will greatly
simplify the process of on-boarding new employees in your organization
and delegate that process to authorized users without giving them Office
365 global administrator rights.

A sample scenario:

-   John, an employee in the HR department who wants to create a new
    user account goes to a specific page on the SharePoint Online Site
    and fills out the form providing all the necessary information.
-   John also indicates his the supervisor, who need to approve the
    request to create a new user account.
-   John submits the form and his supervisor receives an e-mail with
    information about the request and buttons to approve or reject it.
-   Once the request gets approved, John receives an e-mail with the
    login and password for the new account which he will provide to the
    new user.
